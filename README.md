# Differential Methylation in Placental Tissue from Patients with IUGR & Pre-Eclampsia 
https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells12081130

## Introduction
This was an end-to-end methylation analysis of 18 placenta samples, 6 from women with Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), 6 with Pre-Eclampsia, and 6 without pathologies. After DNA extraction, DNA was bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Illumina's Infinium EPIC array, which interrogates ~850,000 CpG sites across the methylome. Data was generated by the array in the form of raw IDAT files. 

## Data Preprocessing
IDAT files were SWAN normalized to beta values using the Minfi package in R. Density plots were generated to identify contamination, and one sample was excluded. A clustermap of all samples was used to identify any global trends in methylation.
