# Differential Methylation in Placental Tissue from Patients with IUGR & Pre-Eclampsia 
https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells12081130

## Introduction
This was an end-to-end methylation analysis of 18 placenta samples, 6 from women with Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), 6 with Pre-Eclampsia, and 6 without pathologies. After DNA extraction, DNA was bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Illumina's Infinium EPIC array, which interrogates ~850,000 CpG sites across the methylome. Data was generated by the array in the form of raw IDAT files. 

## Data Preprocessing
IDAT files were SWAN normalized to beta values using the Minfi package in R. Density plots were generated to identify contamination, and one sample was excluded. A clustermap of all samples was used to identify any global trends in methylation.

## USEQ Analysis
A sliding window analysis was performed using The MethylationArrayScanner and EnrichedRegionMaker from the Useq toolkit.(https://github.com/HuntsmanCancerInstitute/USeq)
Only regions meeting stringent Log2fold and Wilcoxon FDR benchmarks were selected for further analysis. Barplots were generated demonstrating methylation differences at each region between test and control groups.

## Circos Plot
I generated a Circos plot to show the distribution of differentially methylated regions across the methylome.

## GREAT Analysis
The Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4840234/ ) was used to probe for any biological significant pathways associated with the regions of interest. Two biological pathways and one cellular component were identified for the PE regions.

## Checking Correlation with Maternal Age and Gestational Age
Correlation analyses were performed to check for possible confounding of methylation on genes of interest by maternal and/or gestational age.
